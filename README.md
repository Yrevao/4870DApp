# Asset Transfer DApp
- This DApp allows two web services to exchange digital assets with MongoDB and a smart contract for the verification and security of the transaction.
- An example usecase of this is transfering Steam games from Steam to a different game platform; realistically speaking Steam would only allow transfers widthin the refund period of a product due to them retaining the payment of the product for that period.
